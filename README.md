## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Which hooks are available? ###

* ** civil_login_url ** - Override the login page url, defaults to the standard `wp_login_url()` which can also be filtered.
* ** civil_logout_url ** - Override the logout page url, defaults to the standard `wp_logout_url()` which can also be filtered.
* ** civil_custom_js ** - Add custom JS to the Civil initialization, for analytics integration or other custom code.

### How do I integrate analytics? ###

Use the `civil_custom_js` action. Here is an example to be used in your theme's functions.php:

    function prefix_civil_integrate_analytics() {
    ?>
        function myLogEventFunction (eventName, eventData) {
            console.log("Civil event called");
            console.log("Event Name:", eventName);
            console.log("Event Data:", eventData);

            // ...add event to your analytics platform
        }
        Civil({ logEvent: myLogEventFunction });
    <?php
    }
    add_action( 'civil_custom_js', 'prefix_civil_integrate_analytics', 10 );

### Can I use a custom comments template? ###

Yes, in your theme, just create a new template at `templates/civil-comments.php`. The template can be completely custom, just place the `show_civil_comments()` template tag in that file where you want the comments to be displayed. The default template is located inside this plugin at `templates/civil-comments.php`.

### Can I hide the comments until clicked? ###

Yes. In the Civil Comments setting page, check the box next to `Hide Comments Until Clicked`. Comments will be hidden until the user clicks the comments button.
